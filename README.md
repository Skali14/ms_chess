# Chess in Unity
In this project we utilized Unity to create a chess game from scratch, implementing both the backend (chess logic) and the frontend. Additionally we tried to create a chess engine to play against.

## Installation
1. Install [Unity](https://unity.com/en/download)


2. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Skali14/ms_chess.git
```

3. Start the game in Unity.


4. (Alternatively) Download the compiled version via the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Skali14/ms_chess/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## Usage
1. Click `Play` to play or `Exit game` to return to Desktop.


2. Starting with white, alternate between both players or play with a second person.


3. Click `Resign` to Resign


5. `Play again` or `go back to the main menu`
