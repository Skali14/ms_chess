# Chess in Unity
In this project we utilized Unity to create a chess game from scratch, implementing both the backend (chess logic) and the frontend. Additionally we tried to create a chess engine to play against.

  git clone https://github.com/Skali14/ms_chess.git

3. Start the game in Unity.


4. (Alternatively) Download the compiled version via the [GitHub Release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
